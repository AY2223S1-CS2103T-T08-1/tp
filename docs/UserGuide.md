# User Guide

Welcome to the **Watson** user guide! This guide covers all of Watson's features and how to use them.
Throughout this guide, you may see some words in _italics_.
These terms can be found in the [Glossary](#glossary).

Watson is a **desktop app for teachers that helps with a multitude of tasks,
such as handling student particulars, sorting students with different filters,
and more.** It adopts a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI).
If you can type fast, Watson can retrieve and handle the data of students
faster than other GUI-based applications.

## Glossary

* **CLI** : Command Line Interface
* **GUI** : Graphical User Interface
* **Main Window** : The main window of the application that shows the list of students.
* **Home Folder** : The folder where Watson will store student data.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer
(Not sure how? Check out [this](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html) guide).

2. Download the latest `watson.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/releases/tag/v.1.3.trial).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Watson.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Lists all students in Watson.

    * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to Watson, with `p`hone number 98765432 and `a`ddress "John Street, #01-01".

    * **`delete`**`1` : Deletes the student with `INDEX number 1` from Watson.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a user-defined input. An example would be `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `TAG` in `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be excluded. The command can be run as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Watson will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
