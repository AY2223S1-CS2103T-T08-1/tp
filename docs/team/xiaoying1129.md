### Project: Watson, The Teacher's Companion

Watson is a desktop database application that
reduces the administrative workload of teachers greatly.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort students by grade - `sort` command
    * What it does: allows teachers to sort students by grade in ascending or descending order according to their preference
    * Justification: This feature allows the teacher to see the students who are performing well and those who need help at a glance


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add remarks to student - `remark` command
    * What it does: allows teachers to add personalized remark for each student
    * Justification: This feature allows the teacher to add remarks to students which can be used as a quick memo or help to remind the teacher of certain information about the student
